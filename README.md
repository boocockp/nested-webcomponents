A simple experiment to create a pair of webcomponents.  One is nested inside the other in the web page as part of the outer component's <content>, not as a fixed part of the outer component.
The outer component has a data object property.  The inner compnent can use a certain field of that data object without the outer component specifying it. The aim is to allow the outer component
to have different contents in different situations where it is used.
